# Simple calculator run on Python code (4 Operators)
# By @icanonlydaydream

# Changelog:
# v1.1: 20 October: Added support for invalid operators and numbers multiplied / divided by zero
# v1.2: 24 October: Added support for invalid numbers as well as causing program to loop after entering invalid numbers. 
# Added support for looping program and prompt to end program / loop


# Printing instructions on how to use the calculator
